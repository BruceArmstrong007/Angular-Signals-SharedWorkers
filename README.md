# Angular-Signals-SharedWorkers
Angular@next-v16  Trying out Shared Worker with Signals 
# Signals![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48177059/223436371-67e50bec-8aa7-4a61-afb1-15e4e148d963.png)

# Goal :
 To learn about Shared Workers (that share data between tabs and windows) and Signals that is going to be released in Angular V16

# In This Example you will see : 
  1.) Component of Angular Popping in and out of window with the help of portals 
  2.) Same Application that can maintain its state across different windows with the help of ServiceWorker
  3.) Usage of signals instead of Rxjs Subjects to Maintain State in UI.

# Takeaway :
  1.) SharedWorkers are supported in main desktop browsers and can be used share data across different tabs and windows, 
   we can also create a common state management library that works with all frameworks and across windows as well
   might need adoptor for different frameworks
  2.) signals are just dope and exciting, first step from angular to eliminate NgZone

# Known Issues
  3.) Regarding portals, when i try to create a sub window , with ComponentPortal , the styles are not applied in new window,
  unless it is also manually attached with selectors
